        <p>thanks to this new modeling technique, the scanner emits laser rays, which in contact with the object, are reflected towards the base</p>
        <p>surfaces are measured to the nearest centimeter, due to the phase shift between the rays emitted and the rays received</p>
        <p>with its ultra portable design, we can scan your place, without needing to close it or disturb your activity</p>
        <p>it allows us to better meet your expectations thanks to time savings, more precision and uniformity of plans</p>
